But if you want you can adapt code for any type of pholifonic cell. Is there anyone that is able to make it professional by put in all the music for the notes??! This is my first submission and I made it for my father and is new cell.Please be good with me.It's not simple study all by myself.I want to thanks everyone in this community for the good work and I appreciate most of the submissions where I found a lot of good things for my study!!!
